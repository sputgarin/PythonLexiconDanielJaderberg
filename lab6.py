# 1. Veichle Inheritance
# Create a Python program that models a hierarchy of vehicles using inheritance. Start
# with a base class Vehicle, and then create two or more derived classes (e.g., Car,
# Bicycle, Motorcycle) that inherit from the Vehicle class. Each class should have specific
# attributes and methods related to the type of vehicle it represents.
# 1. Define the Vehicle base class with common attributes such as make, model, and
# year, and methods like start(), stop(), and fuel_up().
# 2. Create derived classes for di∆Øerent types of vehicles, e.g., Car, Bicycle, and
# Motorcycle. Each derived class should inherit from the Vehicle base class and
# add attributes and methods specific to that type of vehicle. For example, the Car
# class might have attributes like num_doors, and the Bicycle class could have
# attributes like num_gears.
# 3. Implement specific methods for each derived class. For instance, the Car class
# might have a method to honk the horn, and the Bicycle class could have a
# method to ring the bell.
# 4. Create instances of each vehicle type and demonstrate their specific methods
# and attributes. For example, you can create a car, bicycle, and motorcycle, and
# call methods like start(), stop(), and their specific methods like honk_horn() or
# ring_bell().

# 2. Multiple Inheritance and MRO Challenge
# Task:
# 1. Create classes X, Y, Z, each with an identify() method.
# 2. Create a class W that inherits from both X and Y.
# 3. Call the identify() method on an instance of W and print the MRO of W.
# Challenge:
# 4. Add a super() call in one of the subclasses identify() methods to observe how the
# method chaining works.
